  This is my first project for github haha...
  The project's idea to control temperature in my car using Arduino hardware it will replace exising thermostat.

# Idea

  1. Customize Arduino hardware (4Duino-24, 4 points Thermistor, i.e.)
  2. Coding (May take some time, if i have time)
  3. Wiring
  4. Testing
